          By day I am an economist at the <a href="https://www.bls.gov">Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</a> and by night
          I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in the economics program at <a href="https://economics.gmu.edu">George Mason University</a>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          At the BLS, I work on teams that maintain, analyze, and improve the household surveys and data pipelines that
          determine which stores are visited to collect prices used to calculate the
          <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/">Consumer Price Index (CPI).</a> Using SAS and Python software, I analyze survey
          metrics (response rates, <a href="">non-response analysis</a>), develop and maintain algorithms for record linkage
          and entity resolution, and ingest and wrangle data from multiple sources, including web scraping. In fact, many of
          the <a href="">code tutorials</a> are derived from projects at the BLS.

          About three times a year I am invited to be a lecturer for the
          <a href="https://scs.georgetown.edu/programs/375/certificate-in-data-science/">data science certificate program</a>
          at Georgetown University's School of Continuing Studies. I lecture on using
          <a href="https://github.com/georgetown-analytics/XBUS-506-01.Visual_Analytics">visual techniques</a> to analyze data
          pipelines, from exploratory data analysis to modeling. Visual analytics in machine learning includes feature analysis,
          and model selection, steering, and evaluation.

          As far as academics, the goal of my research is to study the economic processes that guide individuals to transform
          waste, and by-products generally, into useful goods. The economics of by-products is a medium through which I explore
          my interests in microeconomics, economic history, market process theory, and entrepreneurship. Mainstream economic
          methods, such as comparative statics and constrained optimization are the workhorses of economic theory. Despite the
          highly interconnected landscape that defines our society, I have found these techniques helpful. That said, I find
          simulations and networks a more useful modeling technique for developing intuition about complex systems generally,
          including agent-based models and other algorithmic methodologies.
        </p>

          From what I can tell, most of the applied research on by-products compares with virgin materials versus recycled
          materials, focuses on post-consumer waste, and emphasizes environment impacts. To my dismay, the bulk of the research
          is categorized under "environmental economics" or "natural resource economics". My goal is to broaden the concept of
          waste management and analyze how economic systems evolve to handle the production of by-products generally.
