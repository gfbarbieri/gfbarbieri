          By day I am an economist at the <a href="https://www.bls.gov">Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</a> and by night
          I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in the economics program at <a href="https://economics.gmu.edu">George Mason University</a>.
        </p>
        <br>

          At the BLS, I work with the household surveys and data pipelines that ultimately determine where
          to collect the prices used to calculate the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/">Consumer Price Index (CPI)</a>. I have
          worked on projects analyzing various survey metrics (response rates,
          <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/DownloadDocument?objectID=78193801">non-response analysis</a>), to develop
          programs for record linkage and entity resolution, and programs to improve data quality from web sources,
          including APIs and web scraping. In fact, many of the <a href="/code_topics/code_topics">code tutorials</a> are derived
          from projects at the BLS.

          Over the last year, I have been regularly invited to lecture for the
          <a href="https://scs.georgetown.edu/programs/375/certificate-in-data-science/">data science certificate program</a>
          at Georgetown University's School of Continuing Studies. I lecture on using
          <a href="https://github.com/georgetown-analytics/XBUS-506-01.Visual_Analytics">visual techniques</a> to assess several
          stages in the data science pipeline, from exploratory data analysis and feature analysis to model selection, steering,
          and evaluation.

          As for academics, my research is focused on the economic processes that guide individuals to transform
          waste, and by-products generally, into useful goods. The economics of by-products has provided a fascinating medium
          through which to study microeconomics, economic history, market process theory, and entrepreneurship. I expect this to
          continue, but it isn't clear if this focus will be sufficient for a dissertation!
