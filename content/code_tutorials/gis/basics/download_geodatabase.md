Download Census Geo-database and the database documentation.

[TIGER Geodatabases](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-geodatabase-file.html) are spatial extracts from the Census Bureau MAF/TIGER database, designed for use with Esriâ€™s ArcGIS. These files do not include demographic data, but they contain geographic entity codes that can be linked to Census Bureau demographic data, available on American FactFinder.

### Imports


```python
import requests
```

### Download Census Geodatabase


```python
response = requests.get('https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TGRGDB18/tlgdb_2018_a_us_substategeo.gdb.zip')
```


```python
with open('census_gdb.zip', 'wb') as zf:
    zf.write(response.content)
```

### Download Census Geodatabase Documentation

Iterate over content with `iter_content` if the file is very large, otherwise `content` suffices without the for-loop.


```python
response = requests.get('https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/data/tiger/tgrshp2018/2018_TIGER_GDB_Record_Layouts.pdf')
```


```python
with open("Census_Geodatabase_Documentation.pdf", "wb") as pdf:
    for chunk in response.iter_content():
        pdf.write(chunk)
```
