## Instructions
Create a code tutorial:
1. Convert the Jupyter Notebook to a markdown file.
2. Add the front matter in TOML format to the markdown file (title, author, date, description, type). 'Type' links the content to the appropriate HTML layout in `/layouts/<TYPE>/`.
3. Move the markdown file to the appropriate topic folder in `/content/code_tutorials/`.
4. If the markdown file contains images, rename it using the file name of the code tutorial and a suffix number.
5. Move the image to `/static/images/`.
6. Update the markdown file to point to the image's file path.
7. If it is a new topic, add it to the navigation bar in `/partials/navigation.html`.
8. If it is a new sub-topic, add a line to `/content/code_topics/code_topics.md`.
9. Push changes.
