This respository holds the content and code for my personal website. All of the content is available at <a href="https://gfbarbieri.com">gfbarbieri.com</a> or <a href="gfbarbieri.github.io">gfbarbieri.github.io</a>.

## Instructions
Create a new code tutorial:
1. Export the Jupyter Notebook as a markdown file.
2. Open the markdown file add the "front matter" (title, author, date, description, type) in TOML format. Type is important as it links the content to the appropriate HTML layout in `/layouts`. That is, type must match a folder in the directory `/layouts/<TYPE>`.
3. Move the markdown file to the appropriate folder in `/content`.
5. If it is in a new topic, a new item will need to be added to the navigation bar, `/partials/navigation.html`.
6. If it is in a new sub-topic, add a line to `/content/code_topics/code_topics.md`.
7. Push changes to respository.
